                                          We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In
                                          exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:<ol>
                                              <li>Who can use Pumate</li>
                                              When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is
                                              safer and more accountable. For this reason, you must:<ul>
                                                  <li>Use the same name that you use in everyday life.</li>

                                                  <li>Create only one account (your own) and use your timeline for

                                              <li>We want people to use Pumate share content that is important to them,

                                                  and, if applicable, we may take action against your account, for the
                                                  reasons described below. We may also disable your account if you

                                          <li>The permissions you give us</li>
                                          We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:<ul>
                                              <li>Permission to use content that you create and share: You own the
                                                  content that you create and share on Pumate and the other Pumate
                                                  Products you use, and nothing in these Terms takes away the rights
                                                  that you have to your own content. You are free to share your content
                                                  with anyone else, wherever you want. To provide our services, however,
                                                  we need you to give us some legal permissions to use this content.
                                              </li>
                                              <li>Specifically, when you share, post or upload content that is covered
                                                  by intellectual property rights (e.g. photos or videos) on or in
                                                  connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive,
                                                  transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free and worldwide licence to
                                                  host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display,
                                                  translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with
                                                  your privacy and application settings). This means, for example, that
                                                  if you share a photo on Pumate, you give us permission to store, copy
                                                  and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such
                                                  as service providers that support our service or other Pumate Products
                                                  that you use.</li>
                                              <li>You can end this licence at any time by deleting your content or
                                                  account. You should know that, for technical reasons, any content that
                                                  you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies
                                                  (though it will not be visible to other users). In addition, content
                                                  that you delete may continue to appear if you have shared it with
                                                  others and they have not deleted it.</li>

                                                  your actions with ads and sponsored content: You give us permission to
                                                  use your name and profile picture and information about actions that
                                                  you have taken on Pumate next to or in connection with ads, offers and
                                                  other sponsored content that we display across our Products, without
                                                  any compensation to you. For example, we may show your friends that
                                                  you have liked a Page created by a brand that has paid us to display
                                                  its ads on Pumate. Ads like this can be seen only by people who have
                                                  your permission to see the actions that you've taken on Pumate. You
                                                  can learn more about your ad settings and preferences.</li>
                                              <li>Permission to update software that you use or download: If you
                                                  download or use our software, you give us permission to download and
                                                  install upgrades, updates and additional features to improve, enhance
                                                  and further develop it.</li>
                                          </ul>
                                          <li>Limits on using our intellectual property</li>
                                          If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and
                                          make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos or sounds
                                          that we provide, which you add to content you create or share on Pumate), we
                                          retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only use our
                                          copyrights or trademarks (or any similar marks) as expressly permitted by our
                                          Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written permission. You must obtain
                                          our written permission (or permission under an open source licence) to modify,
                                          create derivative works of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source

                                              <li>Updating our Terms</li>
                                              We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to
                                              make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may
                                              need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our
                                              services and practices. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify
                                              you before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to
                                              review them before they go into effect. Once any updated Terms are in
                                              effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our Products.
                                              We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree
                                              to our updated Terms and no longer want to be a part of the Pumate
                                              community, you can delete your account at any time.

                                              We want Pumate to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to use our
                                              services and share their thoughts and ideas.
                                              If we determine that you have breached our terms or policies, we may take
                                              action against your account to protect our community and services,
                                              including by suspending access to your account or disabling it. We may
                                              also suspend or disable your account if you create risk or legal exposure
                                              for us or when we are permitted or required to do so by law. Where
                                              appropriate, we will notify you about your account the next time you try
                                              to access it. You can learn more about what you can do if your account has
                                              been disabled.
                                              If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as
                                              an agreement between you and us, but the following provisions will remain
                                              in place: 3, 4.2-4.5
                                              <li> Limits on liability</li>
                                              We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear
                                              guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Products, however, are provided
                                              "as is", and we make no guarantees that they will always be safe, secure
                                              or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions, delays or
                                              imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also DISCLAIM ALL
                                              OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND
                                              NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not control or direct what people and others do or
                                              say, and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether
                                              online or offline) or any content that they share (including offensive,
                                              inappropriate, obscene, unlawful and other objectionable content).
                                              We cannot predict when issues may arise with our Products. Accordingly,
                                              our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by
                                              applicable law, and under no circumstances will we be liable to you for
                                              any lost profits, revenues, information or data, or consequential,
                                              special, indirect, exemplary, punitive or incidental damages arising out
                                              of or related to these Terms or the Pumate Products, even if we have been
                                              advised of the possibility of such damages.
                                              <li>Disputes</li>
                                              We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid
                                              disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful
                                              to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.
                                              If you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will
                                              apply to any claim, cause of action or dispute that you have against us,
                                              which arises out of or relates to these Terms or Pumate Products
                                              ("claim"), and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that
                                              country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, you
                                              agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively in the US District Court
                                              for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San
                                              Mateo County, that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of
                                              these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the
                                              laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim,
                                              without regard to conflict of law provisions.
                                              <li>Other</li>
                                              These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and
                                              Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and Pumate,
                                              Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede any prior
                                              agreements.
                                              Some of the Products we offer are also governed by supplemental Terms. If
                                              you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be made available
                                              and will become part of our agreement with you. For instance, if you
                                              access or use our Products for commercial or business purposes, such as
                                              buying ads, selling products, developing apps, managing a group or Page
                                              for your business, or using our measurement services, you must agree to
                                              our Commercial Terms. To the extent that any supplemental Terms conflict
                                              with these Terms, the supplemental Terms shall govern to the extent of the
                                              conflict.
                                              If you post or share content containing music, you must comply with our
                                              Music Guidelines. To the extent that any supplemental Terms conflict with
                                              these Terms, the supplemental Terms shall govern to the extent of the
                                              conflict.
                                              If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining
                                              portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of
                                              these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or
                                              waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.
                                              You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms
                                              to anyone else without our consent.
                                              You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your
                                              account if it is memorialised. Only your legacy contact or a person who
                                              you have identified in a valid will or similar document expressing clear
                                              consent to disclose your content upon death or incapacity will be able to
                                              seek disclosure from your account after it is memorialised.
                                              These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our
                                              rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in
                                              connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, or by operation
                                              of law or otherwise.
                                              You should know that we may need to change the username for your account
                                              in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else claims the username
                                              and it appears unrelated to the name that you use in everyday life).
                                              We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our
                                              products and services. But you should know that we may use them without
                                              any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are under no
                                              obligation to keep them confidential.
                                              We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
